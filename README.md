# Accessibility Hackathon App

## Why?

> The lack of accesibility data creates an unpleasant environment some pleople.

## What?

> Our system would gather all this data through the input of interested citizens and validate it through a machine learning model. Because we're using the collected data to provide our captcha service, we're validating and improving our datasets and models creating a feedback loop.

## The project

> This is a repo that includes the services required for the follwing system (TBD)

## Short project description

> Accessible places is a web platform that supports persons with disabilities in planning their next trip through the city. Based on users' input, together with the output from an A.I. system, locations of public interest such as hospitals, post offices, schools and so on are rated based on their accessibility features. For example, a location having an access ramp is considered "Accessible", while a location that only has stairs is labeled as being less accessible. The goal is to help both users and institutions and, as a result, users keep track of locations that they can easily visit while institutions are aware of their accessibility rating, allowing them to improve it by taking the necessary actions.
